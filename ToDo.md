# To Do List
- modesorter creation + load new modesorter device,
- modesorter class - parameters, graphing, etc.
- wavefront matching algo
- later: iterations, wavefront matching algo (in run verify gridsize is the same across the board),
- simulation complete flag, transfer matrix, SVD (IL and MDL) calcs, graphing, save plot functions/decorator
- add flags into mode and modesorter that every bit of info is filled in
